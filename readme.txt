Upload and embed Unity webplayer files.

== Description ==

This plugin takes all the work out of embedding unity3d files into your blog. It enables uploading and download of unity3d files inside Wordpress without any server reconfiguring.

To use, simply add a unity3d file in the same way that you would add an image (by add media and the insert).

== Installation ==

1. Upload `unitydog` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
